## What is Harmony Blocks?

Harmony Blocks is a simple game where players align falling shapes with outlines at the bottom of the screen. The game is designed to promote focus and relaxation by gradually increasing the challenge, without overwhelming the player. 

**Key Features:**
- Relaxing visuals, with soft colors and a gradient background.
- Positive feedback in the form of encouraging messages.
- Adaptive difficulty, making it engaging but never stressful.

## Why Was This Created?

As a personal project, Harmony Blocks was inspired by research into the therapeutic effects of simple, engaging games. I wanted to explore how games could help reduce stress and anxiety while providing a sense of focus.

### Who Is It For?

- **Anyone needing a mental break:** The game is designed to help players take a moment to relax and reset, especially if they are dealing with stress or want to focus.
- **Individuals seeking calming experiences:** With its soft color palette and non-punitive feedback, it's perfect for those looking for an easy, calming activity.
- **People interested in the psychological effects of games:** Harmony Blocks is grounded in research on how certain types of tasks can help calm the mind and reduce intrusive thoughts.

## Psychology Behind the Game

### 1. Visuospatial Cognitive Engagement

The game requires players to align falling shapes with outlines, which engages the visuospatial processing part of the brain. Research has shown that tasks requiring spatial awareness can help distract from negative thoughts and reduce mental fatigue.

### 2. Flow State and Focus

Harmony Blocks aims to help players achieve a "flow state"—a mental state where one is fully immersed in the task at hand. Games like this, with simple goals and adaptive difficulty, are particularly good at inducing flow, which in turn helps improve focus and reduces stress.

**Reference:** Csikszentmihalyi (1990), *"Flow: The psychology of optimal experience."* [Link](https://www.harpercollins.com/products/flow-mihaly-csikszentmihalyi)

### 3. Color Psychology

The use of soothing colors like blues and greens has been shown to evoke feelings of calmness. Harmony Blocks uses these colors in its design to help create a serene atmosphere and promote relaxation.

**Reference:** Wexner (1954), *"The degree to which colors (hues) are associated with mood-tones."* [Link](https://doi.org/10.1037/h0062181)

### 4. Positive Reinforcement

Instead of punishing mistakes, the game provides positive feedback and encouragement for aligning shapes correctly. This positive reinforcement helps maintain a relaxed mental state and encourages continued play without anxiety.

**Reference:** Skinner (1953), *"Science and Human Behavior."*

## Future Development

This is an evolving personal project, and I’m experimenting with ways to further incorporate psychological principles into the design.

Feel free to clone the repo, play the game, and modify it if you like. I’d love to hear your thoughts and suggestions!
