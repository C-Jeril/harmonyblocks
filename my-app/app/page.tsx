            <strong>Harmony Blocks</strong> is a simple game where players align falling shapes with
            outlines at the bottom of the screen. The game is designed to promote focus and
            relaxation by gradually increasing the challenge, without overwhelming the player.

          <h2>Psychology Behind the Game</h2>

          <h3>1. Visuospatial Cognitive Engagement</h3>
          <p>
            The game requires players to align falling shapes with outlines, which engages the
            visuospatial processing part of the brain. Research has shown that tasks requiring
            spatial awareness can help distract from negative thoughts and reduce mental fatigue.

          </p>

          <h3>2. Flow State and Focus</h3>
          <p>
            Harmony Blocks aims to help players achieve a "flow state"â€”a mental state where one is
            fully immersed in the task at hand. Games like this, with simple goals and adaptive
            difficulty, are particularly good at inducing flow, which in turn helps improve focus
            and reduces stress.

          <h3>3. Color Psychology</h3>
          <p>
            The use of soothing colors like blues and greens has been shown to evoke feelings of
            calmness. Harmony Blocks uses these colors in its design to help create a serene
            atmosphere and promote relaxation.

          <h3>4. Positive Reinforcement</h3>
          <p>
            Instead of punishing mistakes, the game provides positive feedback and encouragement
            for aligning shapes correctly. This positive reinforcement helps maintain a relaxed
            mental state and encourages continued play without anxiety.
